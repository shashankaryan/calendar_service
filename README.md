###Questions:
1. Can a slot timing be changed once defined? If yes, what all needed to be checked?
eg. if there is any booking related to that slot, so we need to check for all the booking and slot for every user involved?
- Assumption: No it can not be changed

2. Can a slot be cancelled/deleted?
- Assumption: It can be changed only when there is not any booking related to that slot. For editing a slot, first the related booking will have to be deleted.

3. Can a booking be cancelled/deleted?
- Assumption: Yes, it can be cancelled, but only before the start time of the slot i.e. startTime > currentTime
